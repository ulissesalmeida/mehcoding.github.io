HEY! You clicked on “About”. Do you want to know about me? Really? I’m flattered. I'll try not disappoint you. Let's see, what do you wanna know?

My name? My name is Ulisses, pleased to meet you! “LOL, I think you have a typo in your name, shouldn’t be Ulysses?”. Ahaa! I’m from Brazil. We use “i” here.

My job? Well, I’m former [Plataformatec][plataformatec] software developer. Today, I
write and review a lot of Elixir code at [The Coingaming Group][coingaming].

What I do in my free time? I do stuff that geeks normally do. I love to play video games, tabletop RPG, and board games. I like to watch movies, series, animations, read books and HQs.

What's that book on the right side of the page? It's my book! Yeah, I wrote a book with The Pragmatic Bookshelf. The book is called [Learn Functional Programming with Elixir][book].

That's all. I hope we can hangout some time. You can get in touch using these social networks:
